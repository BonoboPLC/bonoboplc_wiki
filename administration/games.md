### Stopping Games

Stopping a game will stop any open instances and refund all bets. Should only be used when there are no open instances available and after all games in play have been completed.

> **Usage note:**  Before stopping a game, set the game to Closed first.

### Setting a game to Closed status

This setting is used to gracefully shut down a Game. It prevents new Game Instance from being created. 

In the normal flow, when one Game Instance gets filled up or starts on a schedule, a new one is automatically created for other players to register in. 
Like an hourly game or an instant game that just filled up.

If a game is set to closed, the current Game Instance will be the last one and no new Game Instances will be created thereafter.  

> **Usage note:** Set the game to closed if you are planning to turn off the game, or as part of gracefully shutting the system down for maintenance and upgrades.
