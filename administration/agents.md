Sales Agents can be anyone of your staff, an external sales representative or volunteer. 

Sales Agents can use any device, like a smartphone, tablet or PC to sell tickets, pay winnings and much more.

Sales Agents can operate from call centers, door to door or from shops.

You will now be taken to the **Sales Agent Create Wizard**

## Set username/pw
 In the first step of the **Sales Agent Create Wizard** you'll need to set a username and temporary password for your Sales Agent.
 
 The agent will receive the credentials via email and will be prompted to change their password on their first log in.

This store address will be listed on the web site and used for referrals by other Sales Agents.

## Setting Sales & Deposit Limits

You can set limits on how much sales or deposit receipts an agent can have on hand. 

This limit helps protect you and the sales agent against any losses due to theft or mistakes.

Once the limits are reached the Sales Agent will need to remit the balances due before selling additional Tickets.

**Sales Receipt Limit**
This is the maximum amount of Sales Receipts your agent can have on hand. 
Once this limit is reached the Sales Agent will need to [remit the Sales Receipts](/administration/agents#collecting-sales-receipts) to their manager, before being able to sell again.

**Deposit Receipt Limit**
This is the maximum amount of Deposit Receipts your agent can have on hand. 
Once this limit is reached the Sales Agent will need to [remit the Deposit Receipts](/administration/agents#collecting-deposit-receipts) to their manager, before being able to accept Deposits again.

You can limit the prizes that agent is able to pay.
**Prize Payout Limit**
This is the maximum amount that this Agent can payout in prizes to players

## Setting Agent Commissions
You can set  a  **Commission Percentage** for each Sales Agent.

This is the Percentage that the Sales Agent earns from each Ticket Sale, calculated as a % of the Rake (Gross Profits) of each ticket sold. I.e. 

Assuming a $100 entry into a 50/50 game, where $50 is the Rake on each ticket, a 10% commission to the agent would net the Sales Agent a $5 Commission.

The Sales Agent can see how much they would earn for each ticket, in the game selection menu of the Sales Agent App as shown below.

## Enabling Agents to Pay Prizes

By default all Sales Agents are not able to process payouts.  

This helps you designate which Sales Agents can process payouts, and their respective limitations. 

To enable a Sales Agent to pay prizes, please follow the 3 easy steps shown bleow.


**Set Agent Prize Payout Limit**

This **Prize Payout Limit** is  the maximum value that can be paid by this Sales Agent. 

An agent cannot pay an amount exceeding this limit on any prize payouts.  To disable payouts entirely for this agent, leave this limit at zero.

You can use this to allow most agents to make small payouts, but reserve larger payouts for a select few trust Sales Agents.

**Ensure they have a withdrawl float**

**Enable agent to payout from Sales Receipt**

This step is optional, but very useful in helping
