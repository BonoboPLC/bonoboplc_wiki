## Setting Sales & Deposit Limits

You can set limits on how much sales or deposit receipts an agent can have on hand. 

This limit helps you avoid mishaps protect you and the sales agent against any losses.

Once the limits are reached the Sales Agent will need to remit the balances due before selling additional Tickets.

**Sales Receipt Limit**
This is the maximum amount of Sales Receipts your agent can have on hand. 
Once this limit is reached the Sales Agent will need to [remit the Sales Receipts](/administration/agents#collecting-sales-receipts) to their manager, before being able to sell again.

**Deposit Receipt Limit**
This is the maximum amount of Deposit Receipts your agent can have on hand. 
Once this limit is reached the Sales Agent will need to [remit the Deposit Receipts](/administration/agents#collecting-deposit-receipts) to their manager, before being able to accept Deposits again.

You can limit the prizes that agent is able to pay.
**Prize Payout Limit**
This is the maximum amount that this Agent can payout in prizes to players

![Set Commissions](/uploads/set-commissions.png "Set Commissions")
## Setting Agent Commissions
You can set  a  **Commission Percentage** for each Sales Agent.

This is the Percentage that the Sales Agent earns from each Ticket Sale, calculated as a % of the Rake (Gross Profits) of each ticket sold. I.e. 

Assuming a $100 entry into a 50/50 game, where $50 is the Rake on each ticket, a 10% commission to the agent would net the Sales Agent a $5 Commission.

The Sales Agent can see how much they would earn for each ticket, in the game selection menu of the Sales Agent App as shown below.

## Enabling Agents to Pay Prizes

By default all Sales Agents are not able to process payouts.  

This helps you avoid mishaps and designate which Sales Agents can process payouts, and their respective limitations. 

To enable a Sales Agent to pay prizes, please follow the 3 easy steps shown below.


> Set Agent Prize Payout Limit
{.is-info}

This **Prize Payout Limit** is  the maximum value that can be paid by this Sales Agent. 

An agent cannot pay an amount exceeding this limit on any prize payouts.  To disable payouts entirely for this agent, leave this limit at zero.

You can use this to allow most agents to make small payouts, but reserve larger payouts for a select few trust Sales Agents.

> Ensure they have sufficient Withdrawl Float
{.is-info}

Ensure the player has sufficient balance in the [Withdrawal Float](/administration/agents#managing-withdrawal-float)

> Enable agent to payout from Sales Receipt
{.is-info}

This step is optional, but very useful in helping an agent recycle the funds from Ticket Sales into Prize Payouts.

For example if  the Sales Agent has $1,000  in Ticket Sales for the day, but you did not provide them with a Withdrawal Float in the beginning of the day, the Agent can use money from Ticket Sales to pay prizes.

You can disable or enable this setting based o your requirement.

Every Sales Agent has a Withdrawal Float Account in the system which is used for Paying Prizes.

This **account is increased** when the Sales manager funds the account to pay for expected prize payouts.

This **account is decreased** when the Sales Agent uses the funds to pay Player prizes or remmit the remaining amount back to the Sales Manager.

>If allowed to Pay Prizes from Sales Receipts and the Agent doesn't have sufficient funds in the Withdrawal Float to pay a winning ticket, but has enough cash from the days sales receipt, the Agent can use [Sales Reciepts to Pay Prizes](/retail-sales-agents#paying-prizes).
