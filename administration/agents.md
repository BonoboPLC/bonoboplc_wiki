## Setting Sales & Deposit Limits


You can impose limits on how much in sales or deposit receipts an agent can have on hand. 

**Sales Receipt Limit**
This is the maximum amount in Sales Receipts your agent can have on hand. Once this limit is reached the Sales Agent will need to come back and remit the Sales Receipts to you, before being able to sell again.

**Deposit Receipt Limit**
This is the maximum amount in Deposit Receipts your agent can have on hand. Once this limit is reached the Sales Agent will need to come back and remit the Deposit Receipts to you, before being able to accept Deposits again.

You can limit the prizes that agent is able to pay.
**Prize Payout Limit**
This is the maximum amount that this Agent can payout in prizes to players


## Setting Agent Commissions
You can set  a specific **Commission Percentage** for each sales agent.

This is the Percentage that the Agent earns from each Ticket Sale, calculated as a % of the Rake (Gross Profits) of each ticket sold. I.e. 

Assuming a $100 entry into a 50/50 game, where $50 is the Rake on each ticket, a 10% commission to the agent would net the Sales Agent a $5 Commission.
