You will now be taken to the **Sales Agent Create Wizard**

## Set username/pw
 In the first step of the **Sales Agent Create Wizard** you'll need to set a username and temporary password for your Sales Agent.
 
 The agent will receive the credentials via email and will be prompted to change their password on their first log in.

This store address will be listed on the web site and used for referrals by other Sales Agents.

## Setting Sales & Deposit Limits

You can set limits on how much sales or deposit receipts an agent can have on hand. 

This limit helps protect you and the sales agent against any losses due to theft or mistakes.

Once the limits are reached the Sales Agent will need to remit the balances due before selling additional Tickets.

**Sales Receipt Limit**
This is the maximum amount of Sales Receipts your agent can have on hand. 
Once this limit is reached the Sales Agent will need to [remit the Sales Receipts](/administration/agents#collecting-sales-receipts) to their manager, before being able to sell again.

**Deposit Receipt Limit**
This is the maximum amount of Deposit Receipts your agent can have on hand. 
Once this limit is reached the Sales Agent will need to [remit the Deposit Receipts](/administration/agents#collecting-deposit-receipts) to their manager, before being able to accept Deposits again.

You can limit the prizes that agent is able to pay.
**Prize Payout Limit**
This is the maximum amount that this Agent can payout in prizes to players

![Set Commissions](/uploads/set-commissions.png "Set Commissions")
## Setting Agent Commissions
You can set  a specific **Commission Percentage** for each sales agent.

This is the Percentage that the Agent earns from each Ticket Sale, calculated as a % of the Rake (Gross Profits) of each ticket sold. I.e. 

Assuming a $100 entry into a 50/50 game, where $50 is the Rake on each ticket, a 10% commission to the agent would net the Sales Agent a $5 Commission.


## Enabling Agents to Pay Prizes

**Set Agent Prize Payout Limit**
