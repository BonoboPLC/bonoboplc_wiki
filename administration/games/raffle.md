# Traditional Prize Raffles

## Ticket Price

The full cost of the ticket to be paid by player.

## Split of Proceeds

Using the slider, you can easily  determine how much of the Ticket Price goes to the prize pool budget and how much will be charges as Gross Fees.

In the example below only 1,000 tickets are available for sale @ $20 each with $12 going to the prize pool and $8 being charged as fees.

Therefore $12,000 would available to be spent on prizes and $8,000 would be earned as Gross Profit if all 1,000 tickets were sold.

**The Estimated Prize pool Budget:**  Calculates how much you would have for prizes, if all the available tickets were sold

**The Estimated Gross Profit:** Calculates your total Gross fees, if all the avaiable tickets were sold.


#### Gross Fees

Total fee collected from player. Any agent commissions will be deducted from this fee. 


# Setting Prizes
You can choose between Cash Only, and Non-Cash Prizes for your raffle. 

The main difference between prizes in Cash Only and Non-Cash games is that Cash Only prizes can grow with the prize pool where Non-Cash prizes are set prior to the start of the game and do not change or grow as more tickets are sold.

When selecting **“Cash Only” prizes**, you have the freedom of dynamically increasing or adding more prizes as more tickets are sold. 
For example, you can set the number of winners to be 1 in 25, so that for every 25 tickets which are sold, one more prize will be offered.

Alternatively, you can have fixed number of prizes in a Cash Only game. I.e. Only 1 winner, or 3 winners etc. The payout for each rank will increase as more tickets are sold.

When selecting **“Non-Cash” prizes** , you will need to specify the prize for each rank. Prizes can be arbitrary items such as a “trip for two to Hawaii” or an “iPhone” or “$5,000” in cash.
Please note that regardless of the number of tickets sold, Non-Cash prizes are set before the game and do not change throughout. 

> **Usage Note:**  You can also offer a Cash prize in Non-Cash games! I.e 1st Place : BMW 435,  2nd Place $10,000 Cash.

## Non-Cash Prizes

You can easily create and assign Prizes to each rank. 


## Creating & Editing Prizes

For each prize, you need to set the following:

Prize Name,
Prize Value
Cash Alternative (if you allow players to take cash instead of the prize)
A brief description
An Image - For best results use transparent PNG at 600x400 (h/w) at a minimum.

## Assigning Prizes to Ranks

You can either assign a single prize for a rank, or you can specify a range if you have many ranks receiving the same prize.

For example you can set Ranks 5 to 25 to recieve the same prize.

This feature saves you time in editing and assigning ranks.

![Set Prize Per Rank](/uploads/set-prize-per-rank.png "Set Prize Per Rank")


## Managing Prize Budget

When setting prizes, you'll be able to see the total value of all assigned prizes as compared to your prize budget.

You'll be able to easily see if you are selling enough tickets to cover the cost, or if you have room to give away even more prizes.

You must ensure that your prize budget is equal to the prize value in the game.

> **Usage Note:**  You can increase your Prize Budget by increasing the number of tickets, or the portion contributing to the prize pool from each ticket.
