# Creating your Raffle


**This guide will walk you through creating your custom raffle, using anyone of our 3 basic raffle types.**

Traditional Raffle games allow you to offer any type of prize, as well as cash in your games.

**To Get started**

1. Logon to your admin panel
2. Navigate to Games -> Raffles
3. Click on "Create Raffle"
4. This will Launch the Raffle Builder
5. Complete each section, as described below

# Tickets & Price

You will need to configure ticket details including Total No. of Tickets available, their price and how the proceeds are split (Prize pool vs. Fees)

## Total Tickets available for sale

This is the maximum tickets available in this game. This number cannot be altered once the first ticket has been sold.

The maximum no. of available tickets is displayed on all tickets and is used for calculating odds for players.

##  Free Entry Sweepstake

Use this setting to offer Sweepstakes which are free to enter by anyone.

Free entry sweepstakes are a great way for build your client database and promote a product launch.

For more information, please see Free Entry Sweepstakes



## Ticket Price

The full cost of the ticket to be paid by player.

## Split of Proceeds

Using the slider, you can easily determine how much of the Ticket Price goes to the prize pool budget and how much will be charges as Gross Fees.

In the example below only 1,000 tickets are available for sale @ $20 each with $12 going to the prize pool and $8 being charged as fees.

Therefore $12,000 would available to be spent on prizes and $8,000 would be earned as Gross Profit if all 1,000 tickets were sold.

![Ticket Split](/uploads/ticket-split.png "Ticket Split")

**The Estimated Prize pool Budget:**  Calculates how much you would have for prizes, if all the available tickets were sold

**The Estimated Gross Profit:** Calculates your total Gross fees, if all the available tickets were sold.


#### Gross Fees

Total fee collected from player. Any agent commissions will be deducted from this fee. 


# Setting Prizes
You can choose between Cash Only, and Non-Cash Prizes for your raffle. 

The main difference between prizes in Cash Only and Non-Cash games is that Cash Only prizes can grow with the prize pool where Non-Cash prizes are set prior to the start of the game and do not change or grow as more tickets are sold.

> **Usage Note:**  You can also offer a cash prize in Non-Cash games!  i.e. 1st Place: BMW 435,  2nd Place: $10,000 Cash, 3rd Place: iPhone
> {.is-success}


## Cash Prizes

When selecting **“Cash Only” prizes**, you have the freedom of dynamically increasing or adding more prizes as more tickets are sold. 
For example, you can set the number of winners to be 1 in 25, so that for every 25 tickets which are sold, one more prize will be offered.

Alternatively, you can have fixed number of prizes in a Cash Only game. I.e. Only 1 winner, or 3 winners etc. The payout for each rank will increase as more tickets are sold.

### Winners As a percentage of Ticket Sold

For example, you can set the number of winners to 1 in 20 , which means that 1 in 20 plays in the game will win a prize, regardless of the number of entries.

Pre-set Prize distribution tables are used to calculate the allocation of prizes to each generated rank.
Instant Game prize allocation tables can be customized upon request.


![Raffle Cash Percentage Payout](/uploads/raffle-cash-percentage-payout.png "Raffle Cash Percentage Payout")

> **Usage Note:** If a Tournament pays 1 in 20 and has 2,500 entries, then the prize allocation table corresponding to 125 winners will be used.
{.is-success}


### Fixed No. of Winners

Alternatively, you can set a fixed number of winners, i.e. 5 winners, regardless of the number of entries.

Meaning that regardless of the number of entries in the game 10 or 1,000 , there will still be only 5 prizes, each of which will continue to grow as more players join.

> **Usage Note:** If a Tournament pays 5 and has 2,500 entries, then the prize allocation table corresponding to 5 winners will be used.
{.is-success}


![Raffle Cash Fixed Payout](/uploads/raffle-cash-fixed-payout.png "Raffle Cash Fixed Payout")

### Guaranteed Prize Pool

This setting is used to guarantee a minimum value for the prize pool.

If the sum of all the Buy-ins do not equal or exceed this value before the start of the game, the prize pool will be supplemented by the difference.

If the sum of all the Buy-ins exceed this value before the start of the game, no additional supplements are made to the prize pool.

> **Use Case:**  The Guaranteed prize pool is displayed to players from the moment that the game is turned on . If the actual prize pool exceeds the guaranteed prize pool, then the prize pool which is displayed to players will increment up by the value of the Buy-in for each entry thereafter.
{.is-success}

> **Usage Note:**  If the Guaranteed prize pool is $1000 and only $900 in buy-ins have been contributed, then an additional $100 is contributed from Guaranteed Games Expense account to the prize pool of the game.
{.is-success}

### Estimated Prize Pool

This is your estimated prize pool based on the number of entries you expect to have in each game.

This is the displayed prize pool as soon as the game is turned on. It helps you show a non-zero prize pool in order to make the game attractive to the first few entrants.

Once the actual prize pool exceeds the Estimated Prize Pool or the Estimated no. of Players is reached, then the actual prize pool will be displayed and the text "Estimated Prize Pool" will change to "Guaranteed Prize Pool"

### Prize Pool Seed

This enables you to seed the prize pool by starting it a specific amount. 

This amount is guaranteed to be added to the prize pool regardless of number of entries and is done so as soon as the game is turned on. 

This is different from setting a  Guaranteed Prize pool which only adds the difference between the Guaranteed amount and the actual prize pool once registration is closed.

## Non-Cash Prizes

When selecting **“Non-Cash” prizes** , you will need to specify the prize for each rank. Prizes can be arbitrary items such as a “trip for two to Hawaii” or an “iPhone” or “$5,000” in cash.
Please note that regardless of the number of tickets sold, Non-Cash prizes are set before the game and do not change throughout. 

You can easily create and assign Prizes to each rank using the Prize manager tool.


## Creating & Editing Prizes

For each prize, you need to set the following:

Prize Name,
Prize Value
Cash Alternative (if you allow players to take cash instead of the prize)
A brief description
An Image - For best results use transparent PNG at 600x400 (h/w) at a minimum.

![Create Prize](/uploads/create-prize.png "Create Prize")

## Assigning Prizes to Ranks

You can either assign a single prize for a rank, or you can specify a range if you have many ranks recieving the same prize.

For example, you can set Ranks 5 to 25 to recieve the same prize.

This feature saves you time in editing and assigning ranks.

![Set Prize Per Rank](/uploads/set-prize-per-rank.png "Set Prize Per Rank")


## Managing Prize Budget

When setting prizes, you'll be able to see the total value of all assigned prizes as compared to your prize budget.

You'll be able to easily see if you are selling enough tickets to cover the cost, or if you have room to give away even more prizes.

You must ensure that your prize budget is equal to the prize value in the game.


![Raffle Prize Budget](/uploads/raffle-prize-budget.png "Raffle Prize Budget")

> **Usage Note:**  You can increase your Prize Budget by increasing the number of tickets, or the portion contributing to the prize pool from each ticket.
> {.is-success}


## Setting the Schedule

You can easily create your game schedule in this tab.

You can have repeating raffles, or one time events.

![Raffle Schedule](/uploads/raffle-schedule.png "Raffle Schedule")


> **Usage Note:**  You can modify the game schedule without shutting off the game.
> {.is-success}

## Logos & Branding

You can easily customize your games branding and Logo.
