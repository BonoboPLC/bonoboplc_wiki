The Buy-in portion is transferred to the Game Trust account upon sale. This amount should be caliberated to cover the prizes as defined in your payout table.

The Rake portion is transferred to the Commission Earned account upon sale.  

At the end of the game, the prizes are paid from the Game Trust account.
If  there is less funds than were originally estiamted to pay prizes, then money is transferred back from the Commissions Earned account to the Game Trust account to cover the deficit.
