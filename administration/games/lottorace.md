# Revenue Model 
Revenue is earned by charing a Fee on every entry.

The **Entry Fee **paid by the player for each LottoRace entry consists of  the **Buy-in **and **Rake Fee**.

The **Buy-in** portion is contributed entirely to the Prize Pool and is guaranteed to be won in the game.

The **Rake Fee**  portion is earned by the Operator (less any **Progressive Jackpot** contribution if applicable).

This total entry fee is displayed to the player on all pages, except the confirmation page which breaks down the Entry Fee into Buy-in, Fee and Jackpot Contribution as shown below.
