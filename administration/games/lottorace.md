# Revenue Model 
## How to Earn Fees

Revenue is earned by charging a Fee on every entry.

### Entry Fee
The **Entry Fee** paid by the player for each LottoRace entry consists of a **Buy-in** and **Rake Fee**.

### Buy-in 
The **Buy-in**  is contributed entirely to the Prize Pool and is guaranteed to be won in the game.

### Rake Fee
The **Rake Fee**  is earned by the Operator (less any **Progressive Jackpot** contribution if applicable).

This total entry fee is displayed to the player on all pages, except the confirmation page which breaks down the Entry Fee into Buy-in, Fee and Jackpot Contribution as shown below.

## Return to Player

The **Return to Player (RTP)** of each LottoRace game can be calculated as  ***Buy-in/(Buy-in + Rake)***

For example a game with $11 Entry Fee where the Buy-in is $10 and the Rake is $1 has an RTP of  10/(10+1) = 90.9% 


# Tournaments vs. Instant Games

LottoRace games can be configured as either InstaPlay instant Games, or Tournaments.


**Tournaments start at a specific date and time**  and can have any number of entries.

**InstaPlay instant Games Starts as soon as the game is full.**
