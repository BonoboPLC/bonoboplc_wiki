^*^ *Jackpot* Based on payout table
^**^ *Chance of Jackpot* is estimated based on the games Pick Size and Range. I.e. Pick from 1 to 42. 
^***^ *Prizes vs. Gross Revenue* is estimated. See each games payout and odds table for more detail. See more information about budgeting for prizes below.

Entry price and payout tables can be customized if needed.

## How else can I customize my Lottery?

You can add the following:
- Custom Logo & CSS
- Prize Roll Over
- Bonus Balls
- Custom Pay Table

## Is there a software manual?

Yes, you can use this guide to learn how to [create and/or customize your lottery](http://docs.bonoboplc.com/administration/games/lottery).


## How should I budget for paying Lottery prizes?
On average, our pre-configured Lottery games will expect to pay 50-30% of ticket sales as prizes.

This expected value is estimated to be reached over a statistically meaningful sample of tickets sold. As you sell more tickets, the prize payout percentage will move towards this expected average.

However, there can be fluctuations in the short run.

Before starting your Lottery, you should create a **Prize Trust Fund**, equal to your top prize, in case of an unlikely win that cannot be covered by ticket sales.

It is good budgeting practice, that afer each game, to set the aside the expected payout, even if no prizes are won. For example, in a game where you expect 35% of sales receipts to be won as prizes, but only 5% of are in fact won, you should still contribute the remaining 30% to your Prize Trust Fund to cover any unexpected wins in future draws.

The remaining percentages are used to pay for the operation of the game and to your benefit.
