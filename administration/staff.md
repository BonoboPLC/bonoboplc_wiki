These actions predominantly relate to System configurations, Agent profiles, Game Templates, Player Profiles, Game Tickets, Support Tickets and Payment Transactions.
You can view these actions either by looking at a given Staffs activity and viewing all their interactions on the system, or by looking at each objects history to see changes made by any and staff or agent.
