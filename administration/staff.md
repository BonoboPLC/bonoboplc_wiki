## Set username/pw
 In the first step of the **Sales Agent Create Wizard** you'll need to set a username and temporary password for your Staff.
 
 The Staff member will receive the credentials via email and will be prompted to change their password on their first log in.

## Set contact details

Set contact details for each Staff. Be sure to correctly enter the email address so that the new Staff member receives their welcome email. 

## Create the new User

You can set  a  **Commission Percentage** for each Sales Agent.
​
This is the Percentage that the Sales Agent earns from each Ticket Sale, calculated as a % of the Rake (Gross Profits) of each ticket sold. I.e. 
​
Assuming a $100 entry into a 50/50 game, where $50 is the Rake on each ticket, a 10% commission to the agent would net the Sales Agent a $5 Commission.
​
The Sales Agent can see how much they would earn for each ticket, in the game selection menu of the Sales Agent App as shown below.

## Enabling Agents to Pay Prizes

By default all Sales Agents are not able to process payouts.  

This helps you avoid mishaps and designate which Sales Agents can process payouts, and their respective limitations. 

To enable a Sales Agent to pay prizes, please follow the 3 easy steps shown below.

> Set Agent Prize Payout Limit
{.is-info}

This **Prize Payout Limit** is  the maximum value that can be paid by this Sales Agent. 

An agent cannot pay an amount exceeding this limit on any prize payouts.  To disable payouts entirely for this agent, leave this limit at zero.

You can use this to allow most agents to make small payouts, but reserve larger payouts for a select few trusted Sales Agents.

![Agent Prize Payout Limit](/uploads/agent-prize-payout-limit.png "Agent Prize Payout Limit")

> Ensure they have sufficient Withdrawl Float
{.is-info}

Ensure the player has sufficient balance in the [Withdrawal Float](/administration/agents#managing-withdrawal-float)

![Withdrawal Float Agent 2](/uploads/withdrawal-float-agent-2.png "Withdrawal Float Agent 2")

> Enable agent to payout from Sales Receipt
{.is-info}
​
This step is optional, but very useful in helping an agent recycle the funds from Ticket Sales into Prize Payouts.
​
For example if  the Sales Agent has $1,000  in Ticket Sales for the day, but you did not provide them with a Withdrawal Float in the beginning of the day, the Agent can use money from Ticket Sales to pay prizes.
​
You can disable or enable this setting based on your requirements.

​
​
## Managing Withdrawal Float
​
Every Sales Agent has a Withdrawal Float Account in the system which is used for Paying Prizes.
​
This account tracks any funds which are provided to the Agent, by head office, for the purpose of paying expected Player prizes during normal course of business.
​
This **account is increased** when the Sales manager funds the account to pay for expected prize payouts.
​
This **account is decreased** when the Sales Agent uses the funds to pay Player prizes or remits the remaining amount back to the Sales Manager.
​
>If allowed to Pay Prizes from Sales Receipts and the Agent doesn't have sufficient funds in the Withdrawal Float to pay a winning ticket, but has enough cash from the days sales receipt, the Agent can use [Sales Reciepts to Pay Prizes](/retail-sales-agents#paying-prizes).
{.is-warning}
​
>If the Agent cannot pay prizes, they will ask the player to return and attempt to contact the Manager for more funds for their Withdrawal Float account in order to pay the player. 
{.is-warning}
​
>If the Agent cannot pay for whatever reason, an alert will be shown in the Agent Activity. The Agent will be provided with a list of alternatives to present to the player for prize retrieval.
{.is-danger}

​
Every Sales Agent has a Sales Receipt Account in the system which tracks the money from Ticket Sales.
​
This account increases each time a payment is made to the Sales Agent and only decreases when the Sales Receipts are remitted to the Sales Manager.
​
![Sales Receipts Collec 2 T](/uploads/sales-receipts-collec-2-t.png "Sales Receipts Collec 2 T")

​

## Paying Agent Commissions
​
Every Sales Agent has a Commission Account in the system which tracks the oustanding Commissions payable.

​
This account increases each time a commission is earned on Ticket Sales and only decreases when the Sales Agent is paid.
