# Subscription Lottery Overview 

Pay as You Go Monthly Lottery subscriptions (‘Pay-Go’) enable a player to subscribe to one or more Lottery games and make equal monthly payments, over the year.

The monthly payments per Entry are equal to **(Total Games Per year * Cost Per Entry)/12 **

Example: Weekly Lottery at $1.00 equals (52 x 1)/12 = $4.34 Per month.

Here is the general flow:

Once the player signs up, the platform creates the following: 
A)	An Account for the player
B)	A Pay-Go Subscription which is made up of the following
a.	Game Subscription (s) This subscription instructs the system to join the player into each upcoming game, for a specific length of time, with a particular line/selection.
b.	Monthly Invoice (s)  The invoice calculates the total amount due for the next calendar month, based on the Game Subscriptions described above.
c.	A Recurring Payment Subscription. This subscription instructs a payment processor to debit the player's account every month.
