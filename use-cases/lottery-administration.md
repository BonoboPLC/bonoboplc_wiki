# How can I verify that no system components have been tampered with?
The system contains a mechanism which allows any user to verify and authenticate the validity of the software packages currently running on the server.

This is done by comparing the SHA256 signature of apps running on the server to the signature of verified apps uploaded by and created by our team.

To perform this check, please follow the easy steps below:

1. Navigate to My Company -> Applications
2. The verification checks will start running on load
3. Signature of the apps currently running on the server will be compared against official releases
4. An email indicating the results will be sent
5. If the signatures match on all applications and on all nodes in the cluster the application can continue
6. If any of the signatures fail to match, then the platform server will be shutdown, restricting all access to system components

# How can I see all the changes made to a Player account?
A players account can be affected in many ways.

A player can make changes to their own account by updating their address, settings, password or responsible gaming settings.

A player or admin can make similiar changes to the account such as updating their address, verifying a player or placing restrictions on the account.

The system might also make changes to a players permission, player class or segment based on an action taken by the player.

All three types of actions are tracked and available for review by taking the following steps:

1. Navigate to **Players** from the left hand navigation menu
2. Search for the player you are looking for
3. Click on the username to view the details of that player
4. You will now be in the players detail view where you can see all system information about a particular player
5. Scroll down to the last set of tabs
6. There you will find the History, Player Audits and Agent Transaction tabs
7. Each is described below

## Player History tab
