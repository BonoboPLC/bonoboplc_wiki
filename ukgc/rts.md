Where customers hold a credit or debit balance, the pages or screens used for gambling and to
move money into and out of accounts must display the customer’s current account balance, in the
currency of their account (eg dollars, euros or pounds sterling), whenever that customer is logged
in. Where it is not practical to display current balance from gambling screens then easily
accessible links to this information must be provided.
**RTS implementation guidance 1A**

a. Gambling pages and screens include virtual game pages, sports betting coupons, poker
and other virtual gaming ‘tables’.

between products, payments off credit accounts, entry fee deductions, and bonus
information, as appropriate
ii. bets placed, the results of bets, winnings paid

available, for example, £10 taken into game, £100 turned over, £3 taken away from

available to customers, as a minimum, customers must have easy access to details
of the last game played and summarised information for previous activities

Net deposits are defined as the running total of all deposits minus the sum of all withdrawals for
the lifetime of the account. This should be displayed at an account level so the figure represents
the net position of all payment methods. Where full account lifetime history isn’t possible then, as a
minimum, the net deposits should be displayed from 1 April 2018, or the account opening date if
after 1 April 2018. Information which explains the net deposit figure, including the timeframe it
covers, should be provided

either in the currency of the customer’s account or in the currency of the product. The use
