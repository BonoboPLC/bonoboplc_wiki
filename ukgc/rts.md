RTS 1 – Customer account information
All gambling – except subscription lotteries

### RTS 1A

**RTS aim 1**
To provide customers with easily accessible information about their current balances and facilities
that enable them to review previous gambling and account transactions.
**RTS requirement 1A**
Where customers hold a credit or debit balance, the pages or screens used for gambling and to
move money into and out of accounts must display the customer’s current account balance, in the
currency of their account (eg dollars, euros or pounds sterling), whenever that customer is logged
in. Where it is not practical to display current balance from gambling screens then easily
accessible links to this information must be provided.
**RTS implementation guidance 1A**
a. Gambling pages and screens include virtual game pages, sports betting coupons, poker
and other virtual gaming ‘tables’.
b. For telephone betting this information is to be delivered at the customer’s request by the
customer service agent or automated response system
