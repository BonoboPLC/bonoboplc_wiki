move money into and out of accounts must display the customer’s current account balance, in the
currency of their account (eg dollars, euros or pounds sterling), whenever that customer is logged
in. Where it is not practical to display current balance from gambling screens then easily
accessible links to this information must be provided.
**RTS implementation guidance 1A**

RTS 4 – Time-critical events

speed of response, and to ensure customers are made aware of the risk

### RTS 4A

**RTS requirement 4A**
Where speed of interaction has a significant effect on the customer’s chance of winning, operators
must assess the level of risk and demonstrate to the Commission that they are taking reasonable
steps to reduce the risk to customers.

regularly updated information to the customer about any disadvantage that they may be
operating under (eg high, medium, low)

implementing a policy on how simultaneous wins are to be dealt with

because of technical issues such as slower network speeds, or slower end user device
performance.
