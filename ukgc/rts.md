# Overview

## RTS 1 - Account Information

RTS 1 – Customer account information
All gambling – except subscription lotteries

**RTS aim 1**
To provide customers with easily accessible information about their current balances and facilities
that enable them to review previous gambling and account transactions.

### RTS 1A

**RTS requirement 1A**

Where customers hold a credit or debit balance, the pages or screens used for gambling and to
move money into and out of accounts must display the customer’s current account balance, in the
currency of their account (eg dollars, euros or pounds sterling), whenever that customer is logged
in. Where it is not practical to display current balance from gambling screens then easily
accessible links to this information must be provided.
**RTS implementation guidance 1A**

a. Gambling pages and screens include virtual game pages, sports betting coupons, poker
and other virtual gaming ‘tables’.

b. For telephone betting this information is to be delivered at the customer’s request by the
customer service agent or automated response system

> **Implementation**  

a. The Customer is able to view balance on the navigation bar at all times
b. The Customer is able to access "Cashier History" to view previous account transactions


### RTS 1B

**RTS requirement 1B**
Customers must have easy access to at least three months account and gambling history without
having to contact the licensee. A minimum of 12 months of gambling and account history must be
made available on request. The ability to request this information should be made clear to
customers and be provided as soon as is practicable.

**RTS implementation guidance 1B**
a. The gambling and account history should include:
i. credit and debit information such as deposits, withdrawals, movement of funds
between products, payments off credit accounts, entry fee deductions, and bonus
information, as appropriate
ii. bets placed, the results of bets, winnings paid
iii. For gaming (including bingo) full or summarised gaming information should be
available, for example, £10 taken into game, £100 turned over, £3 taken away from
game. Where detailed historic game information may not necessarily be directly
available to customers, as a minimum, customers must have easy access to details
of the last game played and summarised information for previous activities
iv. where customers are able to move funds between gambling products, account
information and statements should clearly display movement of funds into and out
of products
v. an option for customers to use their own defined time period or to select from a
range of time periods. A summary total for the period selected should be displayed
(at least on the first screen or page if the transactions span multiple screens).

> **Implementation**  

a. The Customer is able to view all cashier transactions up to 12 months from the "Cashier History" section 
    The transactions include: Deposits, Withdrawals, Credits, Buy-ins, Entry Fee, Winnings and Bonuses
b. The Customer is able to select from pre-defined ranges to access summarised information and the Net credits/debits in the "Cashier History" section
c. The customer is able to see all past games including the Net for each game played


### RTS 1C

**RTS requirement 1C – This provision will come into force on 1 April 2018**
Customers must be able to access information about their net deposits.

**RTS implementation guidance 1C**
Net deposits are defined as the running total of all deposits minus the sum of all withdrawals for
the lifetime of the account. This should be displayed at an account level so the figure represents
the net position of all payment methods. Where full account lifetime history isn’t possible then, as a
minimum, the net deposits should be displayed from 1 April 2018, or the account opening date if
after 1 April 2018. Information which explains the net deposit figure, including the timeframe it
covers, should be provided


> **Implementation**  

a. The Customer's "Net Deposit" is shown on the main Cashier page. This represents lifetime Withdrawals minus lifetime deposits.


## RTS 2 - Displaying Transactions


**RTS aim 2**
To enable the customer to understand the value and content of their transactions

### RTS 2A

**RTS requirement 2A**
The remote gambling system must make available clear information about the amount of money
being gambled by the customer, including any conversions from one form of currency to another,
or from currency to credits, chips or other tokens etc, at the point of conversion.

**RTS implementation guidance 2A**
a. The financial commitment for each gamble should be displayed somewhere on the screen
either in the currency of the customer’s account or in the currency of the product. The use
of credits, chips or other tokens with no face value should only be used when the
corresponding currency amount is clearly visible, or where the customer is not staking
additional money such as a poker tournament.
b. Any conversion from one currency to another should be clearly presented to the customer
and any conversion rules are also to be presented. Where currency is converted into
tokens, chips or credits, etc, the conversion should be clearly displayed.

### RTS 2B

**RTS requirement 2B**
The gambling system must display sufficient relevant information about the customer’s gamble so
that the content of the gamble is clear. This information must be made available before the
customer commits to the gamble including, for example, in the artwork and textual information
displayed during gaming, or on an electronic equivalent of a betting slip or lottery ticket.

**RTS implementation guidance 2B**
a. The following items provide guidelines about the type of information that may be relevant:
i. selections – the items the customer has chosen to gamble on;
ii. the bet type
iii. the accepted odds, for example current odds, starting price, first show,
etc
iv. the odds format that will take precedence in settling bets must be set
out in the rules.
These items, where relevant, are also required on applications designed for use on restricted
display devices.
b. For telephone gambling the content of the customer’s bet should be read back to them
before the bet is confirmed.
c. Where the customer is able to choose, through the use of a third party user-interface, to
override the display of this information, this must not be the default option. That is, the
customer must make an active choice not to have the information available or to install a
user-interface that does not contain the information. The remote gambling system should
continue to make available or send the information to the customer; it should not assume
that the information is not required.
d. For subscription lotteries, sending a confirmation by email or post and/or displaying the
first draw and the number of draws for which the customer will be entered is sufficient.

> **Implementation**  

a. All games are clearly marked with a Play button so that the player is clear on the items which they chose to gamble on

**RTS requirement 3C**

For each virtual event, game (including bingo), or lottery, information that may reasonably be
expected to enable the customer to make an informed decision about his or her chances of
winning must be easily available before the customer commits to gamble. Information must
include:
i. a description of the way the game works and the way in which winners are determined
and prizes allocated

**RTS implementation guidance 3C**
a. The following items provide further guidance on acceptable types of information about the
likelihood of winning:
i. for types of peer-to-peer games where the likelihood of winning may depend on skill
and/or the actions of other participants, a description of the way the game works and
how winners are determined will be sufficient
ii. for bingo, and some types of lottery or other games where it is not possible to
determine the likelihood of winning because it depends on the eventual number of
participants, a description of the way in which prizes are allocated will be sufficient
iii. the average theoretical return to player percentage. Where an event (other than peerto-peer) involves an element of skill, return to player percentage should be calculated
using either the auto-play strategy or a standard/published strategy
iv. the house edge, margin or over-round, for example for a virtual race
v. the probability of each winning event occurring, or such information as may reasonably
be expected to allow the customer to calculate the probability that the event will occur.
The nature of some games may mean that the game itself provides sufficient
information, for example, the likelihood of rolling a six on a six-sided die would not
require further explanation.
vi. The odds displayed in virtual event betting should reflect the probability of each event
occurring as closely as possible.
b. Information may be included in artwork and text displayed within the virtual game or event, in

and payouts or the means by which these are calculated or determined must be easily available
before the customer commits to gamble.

**RTS implementation guidance 3D**
a. Information should be made available about the amounts that customers may potentially win,
for example in the form of pay-tables, or by showing the odds paid for particular outcomes.
b. For peer-to-peer games where the prize is determined based on the actions of the
participants, a description of the way the game works and the rake or commission taken will
be sufficient.
c. For lotteries and other types of events where the potential amount or prize paid out may not
be known before the customer commits to gamble, describing the way in which the prize
amount is determined will be sufficient.13
d. Information may be included in artwork and text displayed within the virtual event, in ‘help’ or
‘how to play’ pages, or other supporting material.
e. Information should be easily accessible, for example by placing links on home pages for
gaming sections, game selection pages or menus, or within individual games.

## RTS 4 - Time Critical Events

RTS 4 – Time-critical events
Gaming (including bingo), and betting on virtual events

**RTS aim 4**
To reduce the risk that customers are unfairly disadvantaged by technical factors that may affect
speed of response, and to ensure customers are made aware of the risk

### RTS 4A

**RTS requirement 4A**
Where speed of interaction has a significant effect on the customer’s chance of winning, operators
must assess the level of risk and demonstrate to the Commission that they are taking reasonable
steps to reduce the risk to customers.

**RTS implementation guidance 4A**
Examples of possible approaches include:
a. estimating the degree of network latency (delay) a customer is experiencing and displaying
regularly updated information to the customer about any disadvantage that they may be
operating under (eg high, medium, low)
b. applying a handicapping system based on estimated performance and/or system latency
c. treating winning responses that arrive within a period of time as simultaneous and
implementing a policy on how simultaneous wins are to be dealt with

> **Implementation**   

A. Our games do not include any time critical events other than joining tournaments before the start of the tournament.
Connection latency does not play a role in this

### RTS 4B

**RTS requirement 4B**
For time-critical events, the customer should be informed that they might be at a disadvantage
because of technical issues such as slower network speeds, or slower end user device
performance.
**RTS implementation guidance 4B**
a. Information should be included in game descriptions, rules, ‘help’ or ‘how to play’ pages.

> **Implementation**   

Not applicable

## RTS 5 - Result Determination

** RTS aim 5**
To ensure that the gambling system implements the operator’s rules, game rules and betting rules
as they are described to the customer.


### RTS 5A

**RTS requirement 5A**
All reasonable steps should be taken to ensure that gambles are accepted, processed and settled
in accordance with the operators’ published terms and rules, and the rules of the specific game,
event, or bet.
Where unexpected system flaws, faults, or errors that affect the customer occur, steps are to be
taken as soon as practicable to remedy the problem and ensure that the customer is treated fairly
according to the circumstances.

**RTS implementation guidance 5A**
a. Under normal operation, in the absence of technical faults, the system should act in
accordance with the rules.
b. Reasonable steps include testing of systems and new products against the published rules
and monitoring the ongoing performance of those products in the live environment. Refer to
our testing strategy for more detailed requirements in this area.
c. Customers should be notified when errors that affect them, for example, incorrectly settled
bets, have occurred as soon as practicable after the event occurs. Steps should be taken to
rectify the error, for example, by manually adjusting the customer’s account.


> **Implementation**   

A. All games are tested during development against the specified rules and prescribed logic of the game
B. Return to Player is monitored in each and every game to ensure that the entire prize pool is paid out to players
C. Games are routinely tested to ensure compliance with published rules
D. Facilities exist to credit players in cases of where customer satisfaction is an issue
E. If any games fail to play, for any technical reason, monitoring systems are in place to detect the error and attemp to fix it
F. If any games fail, for any technical reason where the error cannot be recovered, an email is sent to the administrator

## RTS 6 - Free Play Games

RTS 6 – Result determination for play-for-free games
Gaming (including bingo), lotteries, and betting on virtual events

**RTS aim 6**
To minimise the risk that customers are misled about the likelihood of winning due to the
behaviour of play-for-free games.

### RTS 6A

**RTS requirement 6A**
Play-for-free games must implement the same game rules as the corresponding play-for-money
games offered on the same facilities (ie the same website). Operators must take all reasonable
steps to ensure that play-for-free games accurately represent the likelihood of winning and prize
distribution in the play-for-money game. For the purpose of this requirement playing a game
includes participating in a lottery and/or betting on a virtual event.

**RTS implementation guidance 6A**

a. The play-for-free game should use the same RNG as the corresponding play-for-money
games, another RNG that fulfils the requirements set out in RTS requirement 7A, or a
publicly available RNG, (such as those available as standard within operating systems)
that may reasonably be expected to produce no systematic bias.
b. Where 6A is not reasonably possible, it should be demonstrated that the method of
producing outcomes does not introduce a systematic bias, for example:
i. if tables of random numbers are used, they should be sufficiently long to support a
large number of games without repeating
ii. the method should represent game probabilities accurately, ie it should not produce
a higher than expected proportion of winning outcomes.
c. The prize distribution should accurately represent the play-for-money game. For example,
where play-for-free games use virtual cash, the virtual cash payouts should be the same
as the corresponding play-for-money game, and where tokens are used, the allocation of
tokens as prizes should be proportionate to the stakes and prizes in the play-for-money
game.
d. Where videos are used to advertise a game’s features it should be made clear to
consumers where footage has been edited or sped-up for promotional purposes. Similarly,
where a non-consumer (eg supplier’s) website is demonstrating a game with higher than
normal returns (ie on a website that is different to the real money gambling facility
websites) it should be made clear that it is a demonstration game specifically designed to
demonstrate the bonus features.

> **Implementation**   

A. All free to play games (Free Roll promotions) use the same RNG and game logic as any other game of the same type
B. The odds of winning, prize distribution and probabilities are exactly the same as paid game of the same type
C. All virtual, play for fun games also use the same RNG and game logic as real money games
D. No edited footage, misrepresents the odds, chances or speed of a game 



## RTS 7 - Random Outcomes
RTS 7 – Generation of random outcomes
Gaming (including bingo), lotteries, and betting on virtual events

**RTS aim 7**
To ensure that games and other virtual events operate fairly.

### RTS 7A

**RTS requirement 7A**
Random number generation and game results must be ‘acceptably random’. Acceptably random
here means that it is possible to demonstrate to a high degree of confidence that the output of the
RNG, game, lottery and virtual event outcomes are random through, for example, statistical
analysis using generally accepted tests and methods of analysis. Adaptive behaviour (ie a
compensated game) is not permitted.
Where lotteries use the outcome of other events external to the lottery, to determine the result of
the lottery the outcome must be unpredictable and externally verifiable.

**RTS implementation guidance 7A**
a. RNGs should be capable of demonstrating the following qualities:
i. the output from the RNG is uniformly distributed over the entire output range and
game, lottery, or virtual event outcomes are distributed in accordance with the
expected/theoretical probabilities
ii. the output of the RNG, game, lottery, and virtual event outcomes should be
unpredictable, for example, for a software RNG it should be computationally infeasible
to predict what the next number will be without complete knowledge of the algorithm
and seed value
iii. random number generation does not reproduce the same output stream (cycle), and that
two instances of a RNG do not produce the same stream as each other (synchronise)
iv. any forms of seeding and re-seeding used do not introduce predictability
v. any scaling applied to the output of the random number generator maintains the
qualities above.
b. For lotteries using external events - where it is not practical to demonstrate 7A the events
outcomes should be:
i. unpredictable, that is, events should be selected only where they may reasonably be
assumed to be random events
ii. unable to be influenced by the lottery operator (or external lottery manager)
iii. publicly available and externally verifiable, for example, events that are published in
local or national press would be acceptable.
c. For games or virtual events that use the laws of physics to generate the outcome of the
game (mechanical RNGs), the mechanical RNG used should be capable of meeting the
requirements in a. where applicable and in addition:
i. the mechanical pieces should be constructed of materials to prevent decomposition of
any component over time (eg a ball shall not disintegrate)
ii. the properties of physical items used to choose the selection should not be altered
iii. players should not have the ability to interact with, come into physical contact with, or
manipulate the mechanics of the game.
d. Restricting adaptive behaviour prohibits automatic or manual interventions that change the
probabilities of game outcomes occurring during play. Restricting adaptive behaviour is not
intended to prevent games from offering bonus or special features that implement a
different set of rules, if they are based on the occurrence of random events

> **Implementation**   

A. Our RNG is tested and certified by a 3rd party to produce uniformly random outcomes over the entire output range
B. Our RNG is routinely internaly tested to pass Die Hard tests
C.  We do not currently allow any outside process to determine the outcome of the RNG 


### RTS 7B

**RTS requirement 7B**
As far as is reasonably possible, games and events must be implemented fairly and in accordance
with the rules and prevailing payouts, where applicable, as they are described to the customer.

**RTS implementation guidance 7B**
a. Games should implement the rules as described in the rules available to the customer
before play commenced.
b. The mapping of the random inputs to game outcomes should be in accordance with
prevailing probabilities, pay tables, etc.
c. When random numbers, scaled or otherwise, are received, eg following a game requesting
a sequence of random numbers, they are to be used in the order in which they are received.
For example, they may not be discarded due to adaptive behaviour.
d. Numbers or sequences of numbers are not to be discarded, unless they fall outside the
expected range of numbers required by the virtual event – such an occurrence should result
in an error being logged and investigated.


> **Implementation**   
A. Game logic is implemented and tested agains the rules available to Customers
B. Pay Tables are used to determine the prizes won by players
C. Numbers are not discarded in any adaptive fashion 

### RTS 7C

**RTS requirement 7C**
Game designs or features that may reasonably be expected to mislead the customer about the
likelihood of particular results occurring are not permitted, including substituting losing events with
near-miss losing events and simulations of real devices that do not simulate the real probabilities
of the device.

**RTS implementation guidance 7C**
a. Where a virtual event simulates a physical device, the theoretical game probabilities should
match the probabilities of the real device (for example, the probability of a coin landing
heads must be 0.5 every time the coin is tossed).
b. Where multiple physical devices are simulated the probabilities of each outcome should be
independent of the other simulated devices.
c. Games may not falsely display near-miss results, that is, the event may not substitute one
losing outcome with a different losing outcome.
d. Where the event requires a pre-determined layout (for example, hidden prizes on a map),
the locations of the winning spots should not change during play, except as provided for in
the rules of the game.
e. Where games involve an element of skill, every outcome described in the virtual event rules
or artwork should be possible, that is, the customer should have some chance of achieving
an advertised outcome regardless of skill.
f. Where a customer contributes to a jackpot pool, that customer should be eligible to win the
jackpot whilst they are playing that game, in accordance with the game and jackpot rules

> **Implementation**   
A. No substitution is ever made in the game logic to give the appearance of a near miss event
B. No simulations of any devices or game patterns are created
C. We do not substitute one losing outcome for another, under any circumstance. All results shown are as they occurred
D. We only support LottoRace, Lotto and Prize Raffle games where there is no element of skill in the game and is purely based on probabilities
E. If a Customer contributes to a Jackpot, then that jackpot is available to be won in the same game



### RTS 7D

**RTS requirement 7D**
The rules, payouts and outcome probabilities of a virtual event or game may not be changed while
it is available for gambling, except as provided for in the rules of the game, lottery or virtual event.
Such changes must be brought to customer’s attention.

**RTS implementation guidance 7D**
a. Changes to game or event rules, paytables or other parameters that change the way in
which a game, lottery, or event works, the winnings paid, or likelihood of winning (except as
described in 7Dc), should be conducted with the game or event taken offline or suspended.

b. Altered games, lotteries, and events should display a notice that informs customers that the
game or event has been changed, for example, ‘rules changed’, ’new odds’, or ’different
payouts’. The notice should be displayed on game selection screens and on the events
themselves if it is possible for the customer to go straight to the event without using a
selection screen.

c. This requirement is not intended to prevent games and virtual events where specified
changes occur legitimately, in accordance with the game or event rules, for example:
i. virtual events, such as virtual racing products where the odds differ from event to event
depending on the virtual runners
ii. virtual games, such as bingo where the odds of winning are dependent on the number
of entrants
iii. games with progressive jackpots, where the amount that can be won changes over
time
iv. games with bonus rounds where different rules apply, so long as these rounds are
properly described to the customer
v. unspecified changes to rules, paytables or other parameters that change the way in
which a game, lottery or event works are not permitted, for example, rules that state
‘game rules may be changed at any time’ would not be acceptable

> **Implementation**   
A. There are no changes to the paytables of the game, except in the following cases:
i) The prize pool increases as new entries are joined into the pool
ii) The estimated prize pool is not met before a tournament is started and the available prize pool is shown instead (In this case the game rules will clearly describe the process)
