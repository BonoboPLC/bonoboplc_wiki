# Sales Limits Overview

Your Master Agent account enables you and your agents to sell tickets, accept deposits and pay prizes within **preset limits** as follows:

- **Sales Credit Limit**

- **Deposit Limit**

Once the limits are reached, or on a periodic basis, you must remit any sales and deposit funds recieved from players to to BLL before selling additional tickets.



## Sales Receipt Credit Limit

Your Master Agent account is established with a Sales Receipt Credit limit.

- **Sales Receipt Credit Limit**
This limit dictates how much (in Nu.) you or your sub-agents are able to collectively sell on behalf of Bhutan Lottery Limited.

Once your total outstanding sales receipt this limit is reached, your sellers can no longer sell tickets until you collect & remit all/part of the outstanding balance owing to our finance department.

>**EXAMPLE**
In a scenario where your account has Nu.100,000 limit, then you or your sales agents can sell up to Nu.100,000 in tickets through the Sales Agent application. Once you have reached Nu.100,000 in sales receipts, the Lottery Platform will restrict any additional sales, until some/all outstanding sales receipts owing to BLL are remitted to BLL.

At this point, you are required to remit some/all outstanding funds to BLL to free up additional sales credit.  I.e. if you remitted Nu.30,000 to BLL at this point, then the balance owing would be reduced to Nu.70,000/Nu.100,000 and you or your sub-agents can sell another Nu.30,000 until your limit is exhausted.

## Securing your Sales Credit

This Sales Credit Limit must initially be secured with a refundable cash deposit, paid to and held as bond by Bhutan Lottery Limited during the term of your Agent Agreement. 

This security deposit, less any amounts owing to BLL will be refunded to you upon closure of your account. 

> **EXAMPLE**
If you wish to establish your Master Sales Agent account with a Nu. 100,000 credit limit, then you must secure this credit limit by leaving Nu.100,000 as security deposit with Bhutan Lottery Limited during the term of your agreement. 

You can at any time, remit the Sales Receipts to your sales manager to reduce the balance owing and allow additional sales transactions to take place in your network.

This revolving credit scheme allows us, and you, to effectively and accurately manage outstanding balances in real time. 



## Managing Sales Credit Limits for your Sub-Agents

When creating accounts for your Sellers, you will specify Sales Credit Limits for each. 

The total aggregate limit you can extend to all of your sellers is limited by the Sales Credit limit on your own Master Agent account.


### Allocating Limits to your Sub-Agents

These Sales credit Limit dictates how much each seller is able to sell (in Nu.).  
Once this limit is reached a seller can no longer sell tickets, until they remit all/part of the outstanding balance owing to you. 

You may allocate and sub-divide your account limits across your sub-agents as you see fit.

> **EXAMPLE**
 if your Master Agent account is alloted Nu.100,000 in Sales Credit Limit and you have 5 sub-agents, you can provide each with Nu.20,000 credit limit. This enables your sub-agents to sell up to 20,000 in tickets before they have to remit their sales receipts to you.  


## Master Agent Sales Receipt Remittance

Guidance for you as a Master Agent

- Keep cash in a lockable physical safe, room or container 
-- Advise your Sub-Agents to do the same
- Do not disclose your sales volumes to anyone
- Deposit your cash into your bank account, twice per week




## Deposit Receipt Credit Limit

# Paying Prizes Overview

If your account is enabled to pay prizes, you or your sub-agents can pay single prizes up to Nu.10,000. 

To pay prizes you can use the **Sales Receipts**  funds which you may have on hand, or BLL will provide you with the necessary funds. 

The allocation and usage of these funds are tracked through the **Withdrawal Float** account. 

- **Withdrawal float** 
Represents funds provided to you by your Manager, solely allocated for payment of prizes to players. 

You can allocate and sub-divide your withdrawal float or collected sales receipts to your sub-agents withdrawal float as necessary.



# Managing your Prize Withdrawal Float

Your withdrawal float can only be replenished in the following ways:

1. Your manager can provide you with additional funds and thereby increase the balance
2. During the course of paying out a prize, you can use funds from you Sales Receipts, if the cash is available and on hand.

- Allocating Sub-Agent Withdrawal Float
You can sub-divide the funds you have received for prize payouts across your sub-agents as you see fit.

> **Example**
If Bhutan Lottery head office provides you with Nu.20,000 in withdrawal float, and you have 10 agents, you can give each of them 2,000.

## How to provide Sub-Agents with withdrawal float

Please take the following steps to provide Sub-Agents with a withdrawal float.

1. Log on to Sales Agent App
2. Navigate to Sales Agents (Left hand navigation menu)
You will see the listing of all of your Sub-Agents on this screen

3. You can view a high level  summary of all listed Sales Agents

4. Click on the Agents name to view the Agent details

5. View the Agents Withdrawal float balance. 
5.i. Provide the Sub-Agent with the funds (via Cash or Bank transfer)
5.ii. Click on the "+" icon to the right of the balance to record the transaction in the system

5.iii. On the following popup enter the amount you provide to the agent
6. The amount should now be reflected in the Balance and the Agent should now be in possession of funds to pay prizes

The amount you provide to the Sub-Agent can come from either your withdrawal float or from the Sales Receipts which you have on hand.

If your withdrawal float does not have sufficient funds, but you have sales receipts on hand the system will prompt you and guide you through recording the transfer.

## Process for using Sales Receipts to pay prizes

During the normal course of business, it is expected that you or your sub-agents will use part of your sales receipts in order to payout prizes. 

There are 2 circumstances where this may be used;

1. Sub-Agent uses their own sales receipts to pay prizes
This mechanism is triggered automatically, if applicable, during the course of the payout.

2. Master Agent collects sales receipts from one agent and then provides it to another Sub-Agent to pay prizes
This mechanism is triggered automatically, if applicable, during the course of withdrawal float transfers to an agent.

> **Example**
Assume that there are 3 Sub-Agents, A, B and C.
Sub-Agents A and B and C have sales receipts of Nu.2,500 each.
Sub-Agent C needs to pay a player who has won Nu.7,500 (Net of taxes).
Master Agent needs to collect sales receipts from Sub-Agents A and B.
Master Agent then provides the funds to Sub-Agent C and records the transfer by adding to the Sub-Agents withdrawal float. The transfer mechanism from Sales Receipts to Withdrawal float is automatically triggered.



## What happens if an Agent does not have enough funds to pay prizes?

It is possible for an agent to encounter a situtation where they do not have enough funds to pay out all prizes. 

In such a case where the withdrawal attempt fails, the Agent is instructed to tell the player to either:
1. Cash out at an alternate lottery outlet; a listing of which is provided to the Agent.
2. Advise the player to come back at a suitable time which allots enough time for the Agent to contact his/her manager in order to obtain additional funds. 

Additionally, upon a failed withdrawal attempt

1. System will automatically notify BLL head office
2. System will log the failed withdrawal attempt in the Agents activity history
3. System will automatically email the Master-Agent to notify of the failed withdrawal attemp


**It is the responsbility of the Master Agent to immediately take action and to provide the agent with enough funds to pay the player on their subsequent visit.**


## How to collect un-used withdrawal float from Sub-Agents

Follow the steps to navigate to a Sub-Agents profile using the Agent Application.

1. Click on the "-" icon located to the right of the Sub-Agents outstanding withdrawal float. 
2. Collect the funds via Cash or Bank Transfer from the Sub-Agent
3. Record the amount in the popup.
4. The system will reflect this increase in your outstanding withdrawal float and decrease the Sub-Agents withdrawal float balance

Sales Agents can be anyone of your staff, an external sales representative. 

Sales Agents can use any device, like a smartphone, tablet or PC to sell tickets, pay winnings and much more.

You can create and manage accounts for your Sales Agents via the Sales Agent Application.


Follow the 2 easy steps shown below to create an account for a Sales Agent

{.is-info}

![Sales Agent Tab](/uploads/sales-agent-tab.png "Sales Agent Tab")

> Step 2 Select "Create New Agent" from the top right hand navigation
{.is-info}

![Create Agent](/uploads/create-agent.png "Create Agent")

You will now be taken to the **Sales Agent Create Wizard**

## Set username/pw
 In the first step of the **Sales Agent Create Wizard** you'll need to set a username and temporary password for your Sales Agent.
 
 The agent will receive the credentials via email and will be prompted to change their password on their first log in.

![Agent Wizard Cred](/uploads/agent-wizard-cred.png "Agent Wizard Cred")



## Set Agent details

You will then be asked to complete a few personal details such as Name, and Birthdate.

Make sure that the personal details such as birthdate are accurate so that you can be sure your Sales Agents are of legal age.

![Agent Personal Info](/uploads/agent-personal-info.png "Agent Personal Info")


## Set Store address

If your agent operates out of a different physical address than your location, please enter it here.

This store address will be listed on the web site and used for referrals by other Sales Agents.

![Agent Store Location](/uploads/agent-store-location.png "Agent Store Location")

## Setting Sales & Deposit Limits

You can set limits on how much sales or deposit receipts an agent can have on hand. 

This limit helps you avoid mishaps and protect you and the sales agent against any losses.

Once the limits are reached the Sales Agent must remit any sales and deposit limits to their Manager before selling additional Tickets.

**Sales Receipt Limit**
This is the maximum amount of Sales Receipts your agent can have on hand; effectively how much Tickets they can sell.
Once this limit is reached the Sales Agent will need to [remit the Sales Receipts](/administration/agents#collecting-sales-receipts) to their manager, before being able to sell again.

**Deposit Receipt Limit**
This is the maximum amount of Deposit Receipts your agent can have on hand. This is used by players to simply add money to their account and is not due to a Ticket purchase.
Once this limit is reached the Sales Agent will need to [remit the Deposit Receipts](/administration/agents#collecting-deposit-receipts) to their manager, before being able to accept Deposits again.

You can limit the prizes that agent is able to pay.
**Prize Payout Limit**
This is the maximum amount that this Agent can payout in prizes to players

![Set Commissions](/uploads/set-commissions.png "Set Commissions")
## Setting Agent Commissions
You can set  a  **Commission Percentage** for each Sales Agent.

This is the Percentage that the Sales Agent earns from each Ticket Sale, calculated as a % of the Rake (Gross Profits) of each ticket sold. I.e. 

Assuming a $100 entry into a 50/50 game, where $50 is the Rake on each ticket, a 10% commission to the agent would net the Sales Agent a $5 Commission.

The Sales Agent can see how much they would earn for each ticket, in the game selection menu of the Sales Agent App as shown below.

![Select A Game](/uploads/select-a-game.png "Select A Game")


## Enabling Agents to Pay Prizes

By default all Sales Agents are not able to process payouts.  

This helps you avoid mishaps and designate which Sales Agents can process payouts, and their respective limitations. 

To enable a Sales Agent to pay prizes, please follow the 3 easy steps shown below.


> Set Agent Prize Payout Limit
{.is-info}

This **Prize Payout Limit** is  the maximum value that can be paid by this Sales Agent. 

An agent cannot pay an amount exceeding this limit on any prize payouts.  To disable payouts entirely for this agent, leave this limit at zero.

You can use this to allow most agents to make small payouts, but reserve larger payouts for a select few trusted Sales Agents.


![Agent Prize Payout Limit](/uploads/agent-prize-payout-limit.png "Agent Prize Payout Limit")

> Ensure they have sufficient Withdrawl Float
{.is-info}

Ensure the player has sufficient balance in the [Withdrawal Float](/administration/agents#managing-withdrawal-float)



![Withdrawal Float Agent 2](/uploads/withdrawal-float-agent-2.png "Withdrawal Float Agent 2")


> Enable agent to payout from Sales Receipt
{.is-info}

This step is optional, but very useful in helping an agent recycle the funds from Ticket Sales into Prize Payouts.

For example if  the Sales Agent has $1,000  in Ticket Sales for the day, but you did not provide them with a Withdrawal Float in the beginning of the day, the Agent can use money from Ticket Sales to pay prizes.

You can disable or enable this setting based on your requirements.

This **account is decreased** when the Sales Agent uses the funds to pay Player prizes or remits the remaining amount back to the Sales Manager.

>If allowed to Pay Prizes from Sales Receipts and the Agent doesn't have sufficient funds in the Withdrawal Float to pay a winning ticket, but has enough cash from the days sales receipt, the Agent can use [Sales Reciepts to Pay Prizes](/retail-sales-agents#paying-prizes).
{.is-warning}

>If the Agent cannot pay prizes, they will ask the player to return and attempt to contact the Manager for more funds for their Withdrawal Float account in order to pay the player. 
{.is-warning}

>If the Agent cannot pay for whatever reason, an alert will be shown in the Agent Activity. The Agent will be provided with a list of alternatives to present to the player for prize retrieval.
