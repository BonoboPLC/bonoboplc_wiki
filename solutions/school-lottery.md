# How do Subscription Lotteries Work?

If you are on this page, you probably agree that Lotteries are a very profitable way for charities and non-profits to raise funds. 

Subscription Lotteries enable you to "sell once" and then generate ticket sales on an ongoing basis. The subscription saves the costs and time associated with selling one-time ticket for each draw.

The Player's subscription fees are billed once a month, in advance, and cover all the games in the upcoming month.

For example, a Weekly Lottery at £1.00 works out to just £4.34 Per month.

Bonobo's Lottery platform enables you to create your own weekly or monthly Lottery, and then sell subscriptions online, over the phone, or even in person through canvassers. 

The subscriptions will automatically process Direct Debit payments, receiving cash from ticket sales and crediting them directly to your Bank account.

# Using Direct Debit to grow your Lottery subscriptions

Direct Debit Monthly Subscription lotteries supercharge fundraising opportunities by enabling charities to easily create a Lotto and then gradually grow their monthly userbase over time. 

The low attrition rates of Direct Debit Subscription Lotteries, combined with steady marketing efforts can produce net positive increases in your subscriber base and monthly income.

Over some time, your Lottery can become an important supplement to your income.

# Pre-Configured Lottery Game Templates

Your lottery platform comes complete with a selection of pre-configured Lottery games and raffle templates.


Each has their own merits and are designed to meet different operations and needs.

You can choose between two different types of games; Traditional Lottery or Prize Lottery (Raffle).

## **Fixed Prize Lottery (Raffle)** 
Prize games offer a fixed number of prizes that are always guaranteed to be won in the Lottery, regardless of the number of tickets sold. Prizes can range from cash, to cars and even experiences. 

![raffle-games.png](/raffle-games.png)

When choosing a prize raffle lottery, you should keep the following factors in mind:

- **Leverage Experiences**: Do you have access to a VIP experience that your supports would be willing to pay for a chance to have? I.e., Lunch with the team captain?
- **Leverage Donations & Discounts**: Do you have access to discounted or donated items that you can put in your raffle? I.e., Include sponsors' names in the games in exchange for a discount which can add to your bottom line.
- **Selling All Tickets**: If you are buying and paying for your prizes, do you have confidence in being able to sell all tickets?


## **Traditional Lottery**
Pre-configured Lottery games offer a maximum Jackpot prize of £25,000 and have preset payout tables. The amount of revenue you earn from Lottery games can vary based on the probability of winning a prize and the respective outcomes in each game.

![lotterygames.png](/lotterygames.png)

When choosing a lottery you should keep the following factors in mind:

- **Estimated Return to Player**: What percentage of ticket sales do you expect to be won as prizes? 
- **Lottery Jackpot Prize** Do you want to start small or do you want to start with the max £25,000 Jackpot? (if you only sell a handful of tickets, are you able to pay the Jackpot prize in case of an unlikely win?)

**See Sample Lottery Games Below**

The following lottery games are pre-configured for UK charities and feature a **£1 entry** with a chance to win a  maximum Jackpot of **£25,000**.

# FAQ
### Can I use your system to set up a Lottery/Raffle at an event?

### How can I pay winners their prizes?

A. If you are using direct credits

B. If you are paying out manually.


### Who is responsible for paying prizes?

You, the operator of the Lottery, would be responsible for paying prizes at all times.

Prizes should be paid from Ticket Sales and your Prize Trust Fund.

### How should I budget for paying Lottery prizes?

On average, a Lottery game will pay prizes, equal to approximately 35% of the value of ticket sales.

This expected value is estimated to be reached over a statistically meaningful sample of tickets sold. As you sell more tickets, the prize payout percentage will move towards this expected average.
However, there can be fluctuations in the short run. 
Before starting your Lottery, you should create a Prize Trust Fund, equal to your top prize, in case of an unlikely win that cannot be covered by ticket sales.

Additionally, after each game, we suggest that you set aside at least 35% of your gross proceeds for prizes. Therefore, if only 5% of sales receipts are won as prizes in any given draw, contribute the remaining 30% to your Prize Trust Fund to cover any unexpected wins in future draws.

The remaining 65% is used to pay for the operation of the game and to your benefit.

### Can I accept Direct Debit payments for my weekly lottery?

Yes, you can accept Direct Debit payments. Lottery subscription payments are processed once a month and cover all the lottery games for the next month.
