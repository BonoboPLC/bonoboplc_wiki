# How does it work?

# Using Subscription to Grow your Lottery

If you are on this page, you probably agree that Lotteries are a very profitable way for charities and non-profits to raise funds. 

Monthly Subscription lotteries supercharge this opportunity by enabling charities to easily create a Lotto and then gradually grow their monthly userbase over time. 

The low attrition rates of Direct Debit Subscription Lotteries, combined with steady marketing efforts can produce net positive increases in your subscriber base and monthly income.

Over a period of time, your Lottery can become a significant supplement to your income.

# FAQ
### Can I use your system for one-time games?
### How can I pay winners their prizes?
### Who is responsible for paying prizes?
### How should I budget for paying Lottery prizes?

On average, a Lottery game will pay prizes, equal to approximately 35% of the value of ticket sales.

This expected value is estimated to be reached over a statistically meaningful sample of tickets sold. As you sell more tickets, the prize payout will move towards this expected average.

Before starting your Lottery, you should create a Prize Trust Fund, equal to your top prize.

Additionaly, after each game, we suggest that you set aside at least 35% of your gross proceeds for prizes. Therefore, if only 5% of sales receipts are won as prizes in any given draw, contribute the remaining 30% to your Prize Trust Fund to cover any unexpected wins in future draws.
