# Managing Prize Budgets

On average, a Lottery game will pay prizes, equal to approximately 35% of the value of ticket sales.

This expected value is estimated to be reached over a statistically meaningful sample of tickets sold. 

We therefore suggest, that you always set aside at least 35% of your gross proceeds for prizes. 
Even if only 5% of sales receipts are won as prizes in any given draw, set aside at least another 30% as a reserve for future draws.
