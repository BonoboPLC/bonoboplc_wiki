# Revenue Estimates

If you are on this page, you probably agree that Lotteries are a very profitable way for charities and non-profits to raise funds. 

Monthly Subscription lotteries supercharge this opportunity by enabling charities to easily create and then gradually grow their monthly userbase. 

The low attrition rates of Direct Debit Subscription Lotteries, combined with steady marketing efforts can produce net positive increases in your subscriber base and monthly income.

Over a period of time, your Lottery can become a significant supplement to your income.

# Managing Prize Budgets

On average, a Lottery game will pay prizes, equal to approximately 35% of the value of ticket sales.

This expected value is estimated to be reached over a statistically meaningful sample of tickets sold. The more tickets you sell, you'll average prize payout will move towards this expected payout.


We therefore suggest, that you always set aside at least 35% of your gross proceeds for prizes. 
Even if only 5% of sales receipts are won as prizes in any given draw, set aside at least another 30% as a reserve for future draws.
