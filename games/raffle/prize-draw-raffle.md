# Mixed Prize Raffle

In this type of raffle, the prize pool grows as each ticket is sold.

The amount contributed from the sale of each ticket to the prize pool is configured prior to the start of the game. 

When the game is first turned on, the Estimated Prize Pool is shown until the actual prize pool exceeds this amount.

## Guaranteed Prize Pool
  
  You can set a Guaranteed Prize which is certain to be available to be won, regardless of the number of tickets sold. 
 
 If at the start of the Draw, the actual prize pool is less than the Guaranteed Prize Pool, then the system will automatically top up the prize pool to reach the Guaranteed prize pool.
