# Cash Accumulator Raffle

In this type of raffle, the prize pool grows as each ticket is sold.

The amount contributed from the sale of each ticket to the prize pool is configured prior to the start of the game. 

When the game is first turned on, the Estimated Prize Pool is shown until the actual prize pool exceeds this amount.  

## Sample Cash Accumulator Raffle

A maximum of **1,000 Tickets** will be available, priced at **£10 each**. 
£5 from each ticket will go to the prize fund, £5 will go to the operator.

We estimate that we will sell **500** tickets and therefore set the prize pool Estimate at £2,500 (£5 x 500).

This **Estimated Prize pool** is displayed on tickets and website, until the actual prize fund, exceeds the estimated prize pool.

Once the actual prizes exceed this amount, i.e. after selling the 501st ticket, the prize pool will increase to £2,505 from £2,500.
