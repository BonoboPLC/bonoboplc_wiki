Your content here


## What are Invoices?
Invoices summarize the activities of a sales agent for a given period. 
An Invoice includes transactions performed by the Sales agents or Sub-Agents (if any exist) as they relate to the following:
- Sales
- Deposits
- Manual Remittances and settlements in period
- Commissions
- Payouts
- Cancellations


## Invoices for Super Agents


## Invoices for Sub-Agents


## How often do invoices get created?
Invoice schedules can be configured on a per agent basis.
A schedule configuration includes the following settings:
- Invoice Frequency; How often the invoice is created. For example every 2 days, every Friday, every 1st Monday etc..
- Invoice Coverage; The period for which the invoice is created. I.e. 2 days, 10 days, 2 weeks.
- Due Date; The Due Date displayed on the invoice. This notifies the customer on how long they have to settle the invoice.

## How can you view invoices for an agent?

### View Permissions

By default agents will be able to view invoices generated for Agents whom are assigned to those agents. 

A Staff user who has "Assign Agents" permissions enabled can assign any Staff Account to a respective Sales Agent in the Agent Detail view as shown below:

INSERT PICTURE

Please note that the permission "Assign Agents " must also be enabled for a Staff account in order for them to be able to view invoices relating to Agent's whom are not assigned to that user.


A Staff user 'manages' or is assigned to Sales Agents - for which they may be responsible


Example: you may have one of your account representatives assigned to manage Master Sales Agent X, Y and Z, and another of your staff to Manage Sales Agent  W, V.

By utilizing this permission model each Staff member, loggin on through the back office, would have restricted  access to the invoices relating to the Agent's whom they are managing. 




## How do invoices interact with current limits?


### Invoice Schedule Inheritance Rules

Each Agent should inherit Invoicing Rules
Updates to the invoicing rules should be kept
Invoicing Schedule should have version numbers.
### Agent Payments Threshold Rule
Invoices must be paid with a payment of at least X percentage of the total due.
For example if threshold is 80%, then the minimum payment due is 80% of (Total Outstanding + Total Due on this invoice).
