Your content here


## What are Invoices?
Invoices summarize the activities of a sales agent for a given period. 
An Invoice includes transactions performed by the Sales agents or Sub-Agents (if any exist) as they relate to the following:
- Sales
- Deposits
- Manual Remittances and settlements in period
- Commissions
- Payouts
- Cancellations

## Invoices for Sub-Agents


## How often do invoices get created?
Invoice schedules can be configured on a per agent basis.
A schedule configuration includes the following settings:
- Invoice Frequency; How often the invoice is created. For example every 2 days, every Friday, every 1st Monday etc..
- Invoice Coverage; The period for which the invoice is created. I.e. 2 days, 10 days, 2 weeks.
- Due Date; The Due Date displayed on the invoice. This notifies the customer on how long they have to settle the invoice.

## How can you view invoices for an agent?

### View Permissions

By default agents will be able to view invoices for Agents whom are assigned to those agents. 

Please note that the permission "Assign Agents " must be enabled for a Staff account in order for them to be able to view invoices relating to Agent's whom are not assigned to that user.

A Staff user 'manages' or is assigned to Sales Agents - for which they may be responsible


[4:35 a.m.] Mark Homayoun
for example Ms. Karma, you may have one of your assistants assigned to manage Master Sales Agent X, Y and Z,   

[4:35 a.m.] Mark Homayoun
and another of your staff to Manage Sales Agent  W, V

[4:35 a.m.] Mark Homayoun
in this way - each Staff member, loggin on through the back office, would only have access to the invoices relating to the Agent whom they are managing


[4:37 a.m.] Mark Homayoun
you can assign a staff to a respective agent in the Agent Detail view  as shown below



## How do invoices interact with current limits?


### Invoice Schedule Inheritance Rules

Each Agent should inherit Invoicing Rules
Updates to the invoicing rules should be kept
Invoicing Schedule should have version numbers.
### Agent Payments Threshold Rule
Invoices must be paid with a payment of at least X percentage of the total due.
For example if threshold is 80%, then the minimum payment due is 80% of (Total Outstanding + Total Due on this invoice).
